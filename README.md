## üöÄ Steps Followed

1. **Data Collection**  
   Employee data extracted with fields: `Gender`, `Age`.

2. **Data Cleaning**  
   - Handled missing values
   - Formatted entries for consistency

3. **Age Grouping Logic**  
```python
bins = [0, 20, 30, 40, 50, 100]
labels = ['<20', '20‚Äì30', '30‚Äì40', '40‚Äì50', '50+']
df['Age Group'] = pd.cut(df['Age'], bins=bins, labels=labels)
